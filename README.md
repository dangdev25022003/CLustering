#CLustering,search embedding

To find the number of dominant images in the folders, you can use the file: full_embedd_cluste.py.
This file uses a clustering method combined with cosine similarity calculations for the leading images in each cluster.
The goal is to identify the desired number of images for a cluttered image cluster.

You can also use the file search_sku.py to search for individual images.
